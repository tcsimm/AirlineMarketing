This project explores U.S. airline market fare data through a combination of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and SQL-based querying. The dataset includes detailed records on average fares, passenger counts, carrier competition, market concentration, and route characteristics. The goal is to uncover patterns in pricing, carrier behavior, and market structure that influence airfare trends across origin-destination (OD) pairs.

The project is structured to showcase a full data workflow: raw data is cleaned and transformed, followed by visual and statistical analysis using Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib). Key insights are also reproduced using SQL queries to emphasize query-based data exploration. The analysis highlights how market share, presence of low-cost carriers, and trip characteristics like circuity impact average fares. This project can serve as a strong foundation for pricing analytics, competitive strategy research, or predictive modeling of airfare behavior.
